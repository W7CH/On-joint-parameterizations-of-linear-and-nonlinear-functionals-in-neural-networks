# On joint parameterizations of linear and nonlinear functionals in neural networks

## Description

The content of this repository is a reproduction of the paper « [On joint parameterizations of linear and nonlinear functionals in neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608022005111) ».

The topic of "joint parameterizations of linear and nonlinear functionals in neural networks" refers to the representation of both linear and nonlinear functions within a single neural network. This is important because many real-world problems (like  speech recognition, financial forecasting or predictive maintenance) require a combination of linear and nonlinear functions to be modeled effectively. By using a joint parameterization, a neural network can capture both linear and nonlinear relationships within the data, leading to improved model accuracy and performance.
